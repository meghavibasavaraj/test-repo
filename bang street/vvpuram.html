<p>VV Puram is Bangalore’s most famous Food Street and a complete must-do for anyone visiting or
staying in Bangalore. Till you get there and try the food, you really don’t know what you’re missing.
This guide attempts to cover almost each of the outlets starting from when one enters the street at
Sajjan Rao Circle. Before that a few basic guidelines about this food street and what we suggest
you keep in mind while planning this gastronomical adventure.</p>
<pre>To taste maximum number of dishes and make the most of this trail, do it in a group of 8 or more
people (who do not mind sharing food). There is so much on offer that just a couple of bites of
the top items at each joint will fill you up to a point when the senses may crave but the stomach
will refuse to take in any more. No point eating one or two items and heading back, we say.
VV Puram comes alive around 7:30 – 8:00 in the evening. While some of the shops start serving
from 5:30-6:00 PM onwards, all of them are ready only by 7:00 PM.
Weekends are extremely crowded so get there a little early. The crowds can mean having to wait
a fair bit of time at some of the shops.
Finding parking is not extremely easy on weekends – try one of the roads leading into Sajjan Rao
Circle if you can’t find parking around the circle itself.
Do use dustbins to dispose of the plates etc. Most shops will have dustbins placed at prominent
locations.
Try and avoid wasting food.</pre>

<p>Now a quick overview of the food before we get into the specifics of what each of the joints serve.
There are about 15 outlets serving different types of food (listed below outlet by outlet). We would
classify the food varieties into the following categories in decreasing order of specialty – from must-
have to do-try to not-what-this-is-known-for. That is not to say that food listed in the last category is
not good – it’s just not what this street is known for. Also, some of those in the last category are
relatively new additions to this otherwise old food street, and purists that we are, we would like to
call them out.</p>
