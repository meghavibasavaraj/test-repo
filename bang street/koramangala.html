<p>Koramangala is another of Bangalore’s hip and happening party and food districts, housing
restaurants specializing in any cuisine you can think of. It is 4 kms from Royal Orchid down a
straight road – the intermediate ring road. Koramangala has super interesting street-side joints,
standing shoulder to shoulder with their more sophisticated, up-market cousins. An interesting
Rajasthani place, a hole-in-the-wall Tibetian joint, Bhajji Carts, Pao Bhaji vans ... lots to explore in
this part of the city.</p>
<p>(Quick advice on the traffic scene. Getting from Royal Orchid to Koramangala can take anywhere
from 7 mins to 45 mins – it is a simple function of the time of day and traffic scenario. During office
hours (read 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM) the 45 min time frame is what you
should budget for.)</p>

<p>It’s worth splitting Koramangala into two sections. The area around Jyoti Nivas College has a
buzzing student vibe. Then there is 80 ft Rd Koramangala that has what could be called the
Koramangala Food Street for the string of street-side food stalls it hosts. (Koramangala actually
had a food street (read about it here) which was relocated by the Municipal authorities a few
months ago. There is hope that the authorities will allow the vendors to come back and set up the
street the way it was but for now all the vendors have relocated from there.)</p>
